{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What problem does Sentiment Chef aim to solve?"}, {"role": "model", "content": "Sentiment Chef aims to solve the problem of extracting meaning from large volumes of customer reviews. These reviews are often buried in paragraphs of text or hidden within videos and photos, making it challenging to understand the overall sentiment and key takeaways."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the initial solution offered by Sentiment Chef?"}, {"role": "model", "content": "Sentiment Chef initially uses MongoDB Atlas Triggers to capture new restaurant reviews and send them to Google Cloud Functions. These functions leverage Gemini, a large language model, to analyze sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) and generate concise summaries of the text. Gemini also extracts sentiment and tags from attached images and videos."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does Sentiment Chef evolve from simple analysis to actionable insights?"}, {"role": "model", "content": "Sentiment Chef evolves by integrating restaurant review data with other relevant information like restaurant details, cuisine, and location using MongoDB Atlas Data API. It builds an analytics engine using BigQuery and its machine learning capabilities to process this expanded dataset, create embeddings for semantic search, and generate nuanced responses to user queries. This enables the creation of a conversational agent using Vertex AI Agent console, providing users with personalized restaurant recommendations."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the capabilities of the evolved Sentiment Chef as a conversational agent?"}, {"role": "model", "content": "The evolved Sentiment Chef is a sophisticated chatbot that understands natural language and can answer questions like: \n\n* What are the best Italian restaurants near me with outdoor seating?\n* Iâ€™m looking for a vegan-friendly restaurant with a lively atmosphere.\n* Can you recommend a quiet place for a romantic dinner?\n\nIt uses the data stored in MongoDB Atlas and insights generated by the BigQuery analytics engine to provide accurate and helpful responses."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does Sentiment Chef analyze media (images and videos) attached to reviews?"}, {"role": "model", "content": "Media files are uploaded to a Google Cloud Storage bucket. Then, a Google Cloud function uses Gemini to extract metadata (tags, sentiment, descriptions) from the uploaded files. This enriched metadata is stored in MongoDB Atlas along with the image URLs, contributing to the overall sentiment of the review."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does Sentiment Chef handle review submission and analysis?"}, {"role": "model", "content": "Submitted reviews are stored in a MongoDB Atlas collection called `raw_reviews`. An Atlas trigger forwards this data to a Google Cloud function. The function uses Vertex AI Gemini to analyze the review text and returns the sentiment data to the Atlas function. This enriched review is then stored in the `processed_reviews` collection. The web app actively monitors for new processed reviews and displays them in the UI."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the purpose of the Restaurant Agent chat assistant?"}, {"role": "model", "content": "The Restaurant Agent is a chat assistant that helps users find restaurants that match their needs by answering questions based on review data.
